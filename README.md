## 🏗️ Architecture

### S3 Deployment Strategy

The workflows use a dual-path deployment strategy:

```
s3://bucket/
├── {commit-hash}/          # Versioned, immutable deployments
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── assets/
│   └── ...
└── main/                   # Current deployment (mutable)
    ├── index.html
    ├── assets/
    └── ...
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Instant rollbacks (no rebuild required)
- ✅ Immutable version history
- ✅ Optimal caching strategy
- ✅ Metadata tracking for audit trail

### Metadata Tracking

Each deployment includes metadata:
- `commit-hash-short`: Current commit
- `prev-commit-hash-short`: Previous commit (for rollback)
- `deployed-at`: Deployment timestamp
- `environment`: Environment name
- `rolled-back-from`: Source commit (for rollbacks)
- `rollback-by`: User who performed rollback

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### 1. OIDC Authentication

All workflows use OIDC for AWS authentication - no long-lived credentials:

```yaml
- name: Configure AWS Credentials
  uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
  with:
    role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/github-actions-role
    aws-region: us-east-1
```

### 2. Minimal Permissions

Workflows request only the permissions they need:

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write    # For OIDC
  contents: read     # For checkout
  # contents: write  # Only when creating releases
```

### 3. Concurrency Control

Prevents race conditions during deployment:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: s3-deploy-${{ inputs.environment }}-${{ inputs.s3_bucket }}
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

### AWS Setup

1. **S3 Bucket**: Create an S3 bucket for your application
2. **IAM Role**: Create an IAM role with OIDC federation
3. **Permissions**: Grant the role:
   - `s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject`, `s3:ListBucket`, `s3:DeleteObject`
   - `cloudfront:CreateInvalidation` (if using CloudFront)

### GitHub Setup

1. **OIDC Configuration**: Configure OIDC federation with AWS
2. **Repository Variables**: Set up environment-specific variables
3. **Secrets**: Store webhook URLs and sensitive data

## 🎨 Supported Frameworks

## 🚦 Best Practices

### 1. Version Pinning

Always pin workflow versions:

```yaml
# ✅ Good - pinned to specific version
uses: your-org/github-workflows-library/.github/workflows/deploy-to-s3.yml@v1.2.3

# ⚠️ Acceptable - pinned to major version
uses: your-org/github-workflows-library/.github/workflows/deploy-to-s3.yml@v1

# ❌ Bad - uses latest, breaking changes possible
uses: your-org/github-workflows-library/.github/workflows/deploy-to-s3.yml@main
```

### 2. Environment Strategy

Use GitHub Environments for production:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy-production:
    environment:
      name: production
      url: https://app.example.com
    uses: your-org/github-workflows-library/.github/workflows/deploy-to-s3.yml@v1
    # ...
```

### 3. Secrets Management

Store sensitive data in GitHub secrets:

```yaml
with:
  aws_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::${{ secrets.AWS_ACCOUNT_ID }}:role/github-actions-role
  s3_bucket: ${{ vars.S3_BUCKET_PRODUCTION }}
secrets:
  SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
```

### 4. Testing Pipeline

Always test in lower environments first:

```
dev → staging → production
```

### 5. Monitoring

- Set up notifications for deployment status
- Monitor CloudWatch metrics
- Track deployment frequency and success rate

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AWS Permission Denied**
   - Verify IAM role has required permissions
   - Check OIDC trust policy
   - Ensure role ARN is correct

2. **Build Output Not Found**
   - Verify `build_output_dir` matches your build tool
   - Check build command succeeded
   - Ensure build output isn't gitignored

3. **CloudFront Invalidation Fails**
   - Verify distribution ID is correct
   - Check IAM permissions include `cloudfront:CreateInvalidation`
   - Ensure distribution is in "Deployed" state

4. **Rollback: "No Previous Version"**
   - This is the first deployment, or
   - Deployment was made before metadata tracking
   - Use manual rollback with specific commit hash

## 📈 Metrics & Monitoring

Track these key metrics:

- **Deployment Frequency**: How often you deploy
- **Lead Time**: Time from commit to production
- **Change Failure Rate**: % of deployments causing issues
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: Time to rollback/fix
